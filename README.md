# Personal Site v3

## What's up
This is the personal webpage for Becky Pollard. Emphasis has been put on design, with the intent to recreate the aesthetics of technology and retro computing. In the past this was accomplished by using webGL to create a 3D glitch effect. In v3 I decided to focus on a CSS-only solution because the webGL usage of v2 was making the fans on my laptop go wild (probably a lot of power consumption too).

The design for the site is inspired by a computer screen, specifically by the moiré effects that happen when taking a photo of most digital screens. I had originally intended to animate a moiré effect in the background of the site, but it made my eyes feel way too overwhelmed (seasick). The solution I settled on is inspired by photos of screens (the refresh rate banding), animated to give it the motion of a CRT screen's jitter, with added horizontal scan-lines to really pop the digital feeling to the piece.

## Résumé Feature

Nobody will notice this, so I'm writing about it here... where nobody will read.

I hate résumés. They're ugly. There's way too much content to cram onto one page. What I hate more than résumés though is using word processors <del>or InDesign</del> to try and create a stylish résumé design. And even worse, when you finally have an okay résumé PDF you frequently need to edit it to tailor to the job you're applying for.

I speak CSS much better than I speak [insert document design software], so I made this template to convey my résumé to the world. I can edit the content in a snap, and save the page as a 8.5 x 11 PDF document easily. It's also easy for people looking to read my résumé, as it is 100% elegantly responsive for any screen (beautiful on mobile). I use a local version to tailor the content for applications.
